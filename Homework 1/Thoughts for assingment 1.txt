I'm not even sure what this Assignment is based off of other than the video? Maybe I'm missing something but I don't really understand
what I'm even supposed to be writing a paper on other than watching the short video and setting up a repository for Github? What am I missing?
If it is that simple that i thought i was very straight forward and enjoyed using GitHub desktop. The UI and the program itself seem fairly straight forward.
I think i will enjoy using it for this course among others.
