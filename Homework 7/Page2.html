        <h2>Summary</h2>
        
        <p>Set thousands of years before the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the series is based on author J. R. R. Tolkien's history of Middle-earth.</p>
      
        <p>It begins during a time of relative peace and covers all the major events of Middle-earth's Second Age: the forging of the Rings of Power, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the fall of the island kingdom of NÃºmenor, and the last alliance between Elves and Men.</P>
     
        <p>These events take place over thousands of years in Tolkien's original stories (Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit) but are condensed for the series.</p>
